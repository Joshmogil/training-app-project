# training-app-project

This is my first Python project, it may eventually become a web-based mobile fitness app, but right now it is just a fun project to play around with APIs and database connectivity

Currently a user can register for an account, login with encryption, and recieve a JWT.

Uses FastAPI with Uvicorn server, Pydantic.
Uses CryptContext for hashing and verifying passwords.
Database: SQLite
